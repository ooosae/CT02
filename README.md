![Project illustration](misc/images/Illustration_02.jpeg)

## Preamble

A resume presents you, your skills and experience.
 Remember that you are not writing a resume for yourself, but for an employer. Imagine you're an employer and you're reading your resume. Before sending a response, think if you would like to invite such a candidate for an interview.

A resume consists of certain sections:

1. Position and contact information;
2. Experience description;
3. Skills description;
4. "About me" section;
5. Other information.

In this project, you'll learn how to:

- create an up-to-date resume and use it for future reference;
- write a cover letter;
- define financial expectations.

## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III
## Position and contact information

Contact information is the first thing a recruiter sees. You'd think there'd be no mistakes. However, let's compare the two versions:

|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John Smith <br /> [kittycat@gmail.com](mailto:kittycat@gmail.com) <br /> Phone: 18002752273 | **OR** | John Smith<br />[john\_smith@gmail.com](mailto:john_smith@gmail.com)<br /> Phone: 1-800-275-2273<br />Telegram: @john\_smith |

Which contacts do you think look more professional?

Basic tips on how to design this block:

1. **Provide Last Name and First Name.**
Patronymic in a digital environment is not necessary to specify, exceptions can be made only if you are planning to go to public sector/banks.

2. **Your email!** No kotletka@, princesska@, kotik@.
Let's keep those emails for other occasions. The right way to name your email is lastname\_name@... For example, malikova\_julia, malikovaj, etc.

3. The **phone number** must work and preferably be the only one that can be reached.

4. **Specify your Telegram username** (make sure you've changed it from @kotik to something more professional).
 Now many recruiters use Telegram for initial communication with the candidate, which is very convenient. You can also arrange an interview date there.

5. **Insert a link to your portfolio (optional).**

## Skills

Describe your skills according to the desired position. How do you know what skills to mention?

**You need to go back to the table with your job analytics.**
 Look again at the jobs you liked and chose. Next, write out the most common skills in the description and relate them to your experience.

There are a large number of [examples](https://myresume.ru/examples/it-specialist/). Write out the skills based on your level of knowledge and experience in order of priority. And of course, don't exaggerate your skills. If you haven't worked with some components or just lack experience, it's better not to specify.

## Experience description

Ground rules:

1. Work experience on a resume is always listed from last job to first job.
2. Your work experience should always include your tasks and outcomes. Any potential employer wants to look at your accomplishments.
 The main question an employer poses when looking at your resume is: "How were you useful to your past employer?"
3. Go back to analyzing job postings, look at the requirements and responsibilities listed in them. This is your top tip when writing your resume.

What is important to include in the work experience?

1. Company name;
2. Period(s) of employment;
3. Position;
4. Tasks;
5. Outcomes.

**1. Company name**
 If you've worked for a large company, chances are any HR manager knows these companies and such a resume adds weight to experience.
 If you've worked for a little-known company, it's advisable to write what makes this company stand out, what the company's area of expertise is. This information can usually be found on the website of the company itself. Perhaps the company is a leader in some industry, and works with large clients (Sber, Yandex, etc.). All of these facts can be listed on a resume.

**2. Period(s) of employment**

- Specify months and years only. You don't have to write the exact dates you were hired and when you left the job. You don't have to list on your resume how many months you've worked for companies.  
 *For example*: March 2018 - April 2020 is enough.  
 If you are employed at the time of your job search, you can specify it this way: March 2018-present

- Always list the experience from your last (current position) to your first position. If you have interruptions in work experience, specify it this way: three to four months at each job. You can combine it into a project activity/freelance.

- You can omit some jobs and say at the interview that you have been job hunting and interviewing. A standard job search can take 3 to 6 months. Try to stay in a job for a year and a half in the future, because those who change jobs frequently are seen by the recruiter as unreliable.

**3. Position**  
Specify the position you held. Preferably, your job title and desired position should be the same.

**4. Objectives**  
 Questions to help describe past experiences:

1. What value did I bring to the company?
2. How does my work impact the company/department goals?
3. How can my work be digitized?
4. What metrics have improved during my tenure?
5. What are my strong competencies? _To answer this question, look at the SWOT analysis assignment_
6. Have I saved any company resources?
7. What do I do best in my job?
8. Have I had an impact on improving any department/company processes?

It's important to write exactly what you did and what the challenges were. It is not recommended to copy-paste job descriptions: no one reads them.

**Example of job description.**  
_Job Responsibilities._ The analyst performs the following job duties:

1. Organizes analytical support of scientific and methodological work in the course of implementation of the program of experimental work.
2. Interacts with the deputy director for scientific and methodological work and methodologist.
3. Conducts analytical work to collect, evaluate and analyze information received.
4. Participates in the organization of scientific and practical conferences, seminars, round tables and other forms of dissemination of experience on the topic of the implemented project of experimental work.
5. Provides consultative and practical assistance to the staff of the institution in the areas of experimental work within their competence.

On a resume, on the other hand, you write the result of your performance in a job, for example:

1. Developed a tool to analyze data quality, used ML and static methods. The tool allowed the customer to save up to 60 man/hours per month.
2. Redesigned the model of classification of accounting texts. The new model is 15% faster and 6% better on the f1 metric.

**5. Outcomes**
 This item is the most important on the resume. The hiring companies are always interested in what results you have achieved, so it is advisable to digitize them. Verbs to help you describe your accomplishments:

- I improved…
- I reduced…
- I optimized…
- I developed...

**Work Experience Without Experience.** What to write?
The most common question is: "What to write on a resume if you don't have experience?"

1. Internships or practicums from School 21.
2. Freelance projects that you can and should put in your portfolio.
3. The learning projects you did as part of your School 21 training can also be recorded as your experience.
4. Participate in a smart volunteer project. Apply for a project, and if successfully selected, complete the assignment and put it in your portfolio. (ProCharity).
5. Professional Projects. Programmers can participate in [Open Source projects](https://tproger.ru/articles/open-source-for-beginners/).
6. Experience in case championships and hackathons.

## "About me" section

What should I write in the about me section?

1. First and foremost, list your strengths that are important for the desired position.
 Even if you lack relevant experience, you can find strengths. This is most often the case with so-called "soft skills". Always appeal to your past experience as to why you think a particular skill is your strength. Look at last project exercise 2, where you did an analysis of your strengths and weaknesses.

2. Write about your desire and ambition to develop in a new field. Tell people why you want to develop, what brought you into this field, etc. You can also attach a link to your portfolio/website/professional blog.

_Tip #1:_

1. In the section, you can state your goal. Write about why you love your job and what inspires you.
2. Indicate your qualities that are not related to the position, such as your athletic accomplishments.
3. Specify your soft skills.
 Make sure you don't put it like that: stress-resistant, proactive, communicative, etc. When pointing out such skills, go back to your past experiences. Ask yourself: why do I have leadership skills? Perhaps you had experience as a project leader when you were a student? What made you stress-resistant?

## Where to create a resume?

1. Make a resume on hh.ru.
2. Use resume builders, such as: BuduJobs, Icanchoose, Grintern, Novoresume, MyResume.ru.
3. Use ready-made templates in Canva.
4. Format your resume in Word (and save as a PDF).
5. Create a resume in Word, save it on Google drive and send a link to your resume.
 (Don't forget to open access).
6. Create a resume in Notion.

_Tip #1 "Make two resumes: One on HH.ru, and the second in any builder"_  
HH.ru is a starting point in the job search. You can use a different resume for other career sites or when looking for a job in telegram channels.

_Tip #2. "No more than 2 pages, but preferably one"_  
 The standard resume is 2 pages. You should place the most important information on the first page. But remember, it doesn't matter how many pages you have on your resume, what matters is that your resume is engaging.

## Typical mistakes when making a resume

| Mistake | How to fix it |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Lack of achievement in your work experience | Outline not only your responsibilities, but also state your KPIs. For example:<br/> - was one of the top 3 students in the course;<br/> - Served as a mentor to 5+ fellow students, assisted in mastering the curriculum;<br/> - completed 30+ learning projects.<br/> KPIs are measurable indicators of your performance. This data shows your effectiveness, and that's what the employer is interested in. |
| 2. Incorrect level of foreign language proficiency is indicated | Be honest and specify the one you currently have. Beginner; Elementary level; Pre-Intermediate; Intermediate; Upper Intermediate; Advanced; Mastery/proficiency. |
| 3. Spelling mistakes in a resume | Ask your friend/teacher/mentor to check your resume or use this [website](https://glvrd.ru/). |
| 4. Incorrect salary expectations | Research the salary market in your industry and in your region. |
| 5. Indication of non-core experience | Take it off your resume if it doesn't fit the desired position. |
| 6. The resume is too long (3 or more pages) | Eliminate the unnecessary: the resume should be informative and concise. Two pages at most! |

## Cover letter

Why and when do I need a cover letter?

1. Cover letter is needed when it is asked to write one in the job description.
 If this paragraph is there, it is better not to neglect it and fulfill the condition.
2. If you're changing fields, it's imperative to write about your new motivation in your cover letter.
3. If you are a young professional and just starting your career.
4. If there is no vacancy in the company itself, but you really want to work there.

You need to answer two questions in your cover letter:

1. Why does the company need you?
2. Why do you need the company?

Answer yourself the question, "What is it that hooks you? Why do you really want to work there?
 Show your motivation.

**Step 1.** Analyze the company/job/project.

- tasks at the desired position (problems, priorities);
- candidate requirements;
- company mission;
- values;
- the qualities that a particular company values.

**Step 2.** Answer the questions:

- What do I know about the company?
- What motivates me in this position?
- To what extent is this position a logical extension of my career?
- What can I do to solve a particular problem?
- What skills, knowledge, accomplishments do I possess to qualify for this position?

**Step 3.** Compose a cover letter using the structure:

1. A brief greeting (If you know the HR's name, use it in your greeting).
2. Tell me what position you're applying for if you're sending a resume to an employer's work email. It's better to state exactly where you saw the job posting.
3. Interest in the job/company/project (Answer the question: Why is the company interesting to you?).
4. Strengths according to the desired position (Answer the question: Why might this company be interested in you?).
5. Again, remind everybody of your motivation. For example: I would be happy to be considered for the position.
6. Include your contact information.

Example of a [Cover Letter](materials/Cover_Letter.pdf). (available for download in the folder materials -> Cover_Letter)

## How do you talk about salary?

Try to stay on top of the salary analytics market. You can always look at your job analytics file.  
 There's a lot of information in open sources about the average salary range for specialists.

Useful resources for salary analytics:

1. Zarplatomer (SuperJob -\> Zarplatomer);
2. Salary Survey (CAUS - Salary Survey);
3. Staffing agencies that perform salary analytics (RealHR).

To negotiate salary, whether at the recruitment stage or when talking about a raise, it's important to understand how much your labor is worth in the market:

- Prepare yourself for the question "Why should we raise your salary?" What matters here is that you are showing results and your hard work in the company is making a difference/money. Then prepare a little progress report. What did you do? What have you accomplished? How was \*something\*/how is it now? What has improved as a result of your work/what indicators have increased/decreased due to what/what resources?
- Look at the job analytics yourself. You've done job analytics on a past project. This is also your clue for salary negotiations.  
 If most of your skills match your desired positions, it's a good reason to talk to the person responsible about a raise.
